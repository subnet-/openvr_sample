This is a collection of basic tools to work with OpenGL 4.x.

The following standard OpenGL libraries are included:

GLM	           -- http://glm.g-truc.net/ (2016-07-16 - GLM 0.9.7.6)
GLEW	       -- http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Additionally, the following headers describe interfaces to basic
functionality:

gltool.hpp     -- Tools to compile/link shaders, and to check for errors
geomload.hpp   -- Simple geometry loader, for .obj and .ply files
texload.hpp    -- Simple texture loader, for .png and optionally for .gta files

The following libraries are included and used internally to provide the
functionality described above:

tinyobjloader  -- https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
ply_io	       -- originally by Greg Turk, but we use the patched version
		  from https://github.com/Eyescale/Equalizer
